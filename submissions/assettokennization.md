# Project Name: Asset Tokenization 

# Authors and Github username: Dharti Parikh and D1830p

# Description of the Project 

A layer 2 tokenization solution over a decentralized network, managed by smart contract to release tokens per participant and eventually share the profits using EIP1973

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

Buying a big asset is difficult for one person and the accredited investors have captured the market from a long time. 
One of the primary reason is that there is no structured way to ensure proper distribution of profits and shares.
Such assets could be digital or tangible assets like antiques, gold, real estate etc.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

Tokenizing such assets prove to be a major application in blockchain. The primary thing is tokenizing the whole asset into multiple units, called tokens otherwise.
Once you register that on the Blockchain, EIP 1973 can be used to pay off all the participants and eventually those rewards would decrease with time creating an initial boost in investment. Such a use case enables a group of investors to decentralize ownership and ethically distribute the funds and profits.

A company  sells antique paintings of very high prices and in that customers can get the fractional ownership of that paintings. Customers gets the tokens in the form of rewards and its proportional to the fractional part they buy  in the painting.
With the help of that token they can invest into another paintings for low price in comparison to new customer and they get the first priority.

For example:-
Fractional part the customer buys -> bonus rewards - profit depends on the fractional part.
>=3/4 part of painting -> 4% 
>=2/4th part of painting -> 3% 
>=1/4th part of painting -> 2% 
0- 1/4th part of painting -> 0%
