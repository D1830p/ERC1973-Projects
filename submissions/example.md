# Project Name: Krawlcat 

# Authors and Github username: Lee Raj (@lerajk)

# Description of the Project 

A Layer-2 decentralized oracle protocol that aggregates cryptocurrency prices from various nodes within the network. 

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

Participating nodes in the Krawlcat network need to be incentivized when contributing good data and punished for providing fraudulent data. When the nodes in the network reach a higher limit (100s, 1000s), ERC20 reward distribution faces a bottleneck due to block gas limit.  

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

Sound application of ERC 1973 allows ERC20 reward distribution in a scalable manner to all the partcipating nodes.
